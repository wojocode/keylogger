### About
This program is listening for keystrokes and send it via mail. 
You can specify the time interval and set your mail addresses as well as password.
I put my sensitive data in the environment variable for safety reason. 


### Usage:
1. Clone it:
`git clone  https://github.com/wojocode/keylogger.git`

2.  pip install pynput

3. Run it:
`python key.py`
